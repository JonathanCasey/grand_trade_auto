## One-time Setup

### CircleCI
If forking this project, CircleCI will need contexts setup.  See
`.circleci/config.yml` for the contexts needed; the contents should be mostly
obvious (e.g. `docker-hub-creds` is intended to defind the user/pass env vars).
For the Docker Hub password, an access token should be created on the Security
page of your Docker Hub account profile.
